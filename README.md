# The Adventures Of Dr.Octavious #

## Project Description ##
This branch holds all the required classes needed to run our latest rendition of the Dr.Octavious game.
The object of the game is to navigate the map(using W,A,S,D) in order to collect the coins(Gold circles) and avoid enemies(red squares).After collecting all the coins, a key(green circle) will appear, upon picking up the key the game comes to an end.
At the top left of the screen there is a health bar indicating how close a player is to dying, and it also displays the number of coins collected. In order to set the highest score possible players must attempt to finish the game as fast as they can.


## Downloading ##
In order to run this game you must have java installed.
Go to the 'Demo2' branch and click on the 'src' folder.
Download all the classes in the src folder and unzip them
Put them in the same package in eclipse or the IDE of your choice.
ensure that you have downloaded the clouds.jpg image and imported that into the package as well, the code will not compile if this image isn't imported.

Alternatively, you can launch the game from the console by downloading the src folder into the directory of your chosing.
Launch the console, and go to said directory,
type:

javac Main.java
After a successful compile:
java Main

## How To Launch ##
After all classes are compiled and in the same package run the 'Main.java' class .
this should display a new window that allows you to move around your character and explore the world.
